Portfolio Project: Social Media App Usage Analysis
Overview
Welcome to my Social Media App Usage Analysis project! In this portfolio piece, I delve into the fascinating world of social media usage patterns, leveraging raw data sourced from Kaggle. This project showcases my skills in data cleaning, SQL querying, and data visualization, ultimately providing actionable insights into user behavior across various social media platforms.
Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:
Clean and Prepare Data: Transform raw CSV data into a structured format suitable for analysis.
Perform SQL Queries: Utilize MySQL Workbench to extract meaningful insights from the cleaned data.
Generate Key Metrics: Calculate average activity per hour, average app activity, daily usage per app, total users per app, and identify the top 10 social media users.
Visualize Insights: Create compelling visualizations using Power BI to present findings in an easily digestible format.
Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle, containing comprehensive records of social media app usage. The data includes user activity logs, timestamps, and app identifiers, providing a rich foundation for analysis.
Data Cleaning Process
The initial step involved cleaning the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Key cleaning tasks included:
Handling Missing Values: Identified and addressed missing entries to maintain data integrity.
Data Type Conversion: Converted timestamps and numerical values to appropriate formats for analysis.
Normalization: Standardized app names and user identifiers to eliminate discrepancies.
SQL Queries and Insights
Using MySQL Workbench, I executed a series of queries to extract valuable insights from the cleaned dataset. Key findings include:
Average Activity per Hour: Analyzed user engagement patterns to determine peak usage times.
Average App Activity: Calculated the average time spent on each app, revealing user preferences.
Average Daily Usage: Assessed daily usage metrics for each app, highlighting trends in user behavior.
Total Users per App: Identified the total number of users engaging with each social media platform.
Top 10 Social Media Users: Compiled a list of the most active users, providing insights into influencer engagement.
Data Visualization
To effectively communicate the insights derived from the analysis, I utilized Power BI to create interactive dashboards.
